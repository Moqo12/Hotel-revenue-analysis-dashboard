Created a database in SQL Server Management to further analysis hotel booking data.

# Fetched the data from excel
select * from dbo.['2018$']
select * from dbo.['2019$']
select * from dbo.['2020$']

# Combined the data
select * from dbo.['2018$']
union
select * from dbo.['2019$']
union
select * from dbo.['2020$']

# Explorator Data Analysis
# 1. Is our hotel revenue growing yearly?
# 2. Should we increase our parking lot size?
# 3. What trends can we see in the data?

# Created a table with the combined data 
with hotels as(
select * from dbo.['2018$']
union
select * from dbo.['2019$']
union
select * from dbo.['2020$'])
select * from hotels

#Q1.  Is our hotel revenue growing yearly?
# Create a new column Revenue as we have adr (Average Daily Rate), stays_in_week_nights, and stays_in _weekend_nights. 

select 
  (stays_in_week_nights + stays_in_weekend_nights) * adr
  as revenue from hotels

#bring another column arrival_date_year from the data and then calculate the sum of revenue while grouping the data by year.
select 
arrival_date_year
sum((stays_in_week_nights + stays_in_weekend_nights) * adr)
as revenue from hotels group by arrival_date_year

# create revenue trend by hotel
select 
arrival_date_year, hotel,
sum((stays_in_week_nights + stays_in_weekend_nights) * adr)
as revenue from hotels group by arrival_date_year, hotel

#Q2.Should we increase our parking lot size? 
select
arrival_date_year, hotel,
sum((stays_in_week_nights + stays_in_weekend _nights) * adr) as renenue,
concat (round((sum(required_car_parking_spaces)/sum(stays_in_week_nights +
stays_in_weekend_nights)) * 100, 2), '%') as parking_percentage
from hotels group by arrival_date_year, hotel

# from the table created from the sql query we can observe that we have enough space for parking. So, there is no need to increase our parking lot size.

# Preprocessing before tranferring queries into power BI
#First Left Join: Combines the hotels table with the market_segment table by matching the market_segment column in the “hotels” table with the market_segment.market_segment column
#Second Left Join: Combines the hotels table with the meal_cost table by matching the meal column in the hotels table and the meal_cost.meal column.

with hotels as(
select * from dbo.['2018$']
union
select * from dbo.['2019$']
union
select * from dbo.['2020$'])

select * from hotels
left join dbo.market_segment$
on hotels.market_segment = market_segment$.market_segment
left join dbo.meal_cost$
on meal_cost$.meal = hotels.meal


#Q3. What trends can we see in the data?
#Revenue increased from 2018 to 2019, but it began to decrease from 2019 to 2020.
#The average daily rate (ADR) has increased from 2019 to 2020, from $99.53 to $104.47.
#Total number of nights booked by customers decreased from 2019 to 2020.
T#he discount percentage offered by the hotel has increased from 2019 to 2020 to attract more customers.
